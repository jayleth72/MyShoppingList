App Service Helpers (ASH) makes it as easy as possible to add data storage and authentication to your mobile app with Microsoft's Azure App Service Platform. ASH was built with the mobile developer in mind, and requires no previous experience with backends as a service (BaaS).

In just four lines of code, you can connect your app to the cloud with online/offline synchronization and automatic conflict resolution. Authenticating users with Facebook, Twitter, Google, Microsoft accounts, Azure AD, and Azure B2C is dead simple as well - just one line of code. ASH even takes care of securely storing access tokens and refreshing them regularly, with no extra effort required from you.

App Service Helpers was developed as a supplemental library to [Microsoft's Azure Client SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Client/). Rather than replacing this library, ASH extends it by lowering the barrier to entry for developers who wish to build cloud-connected mobile apps in C#. If you ever find yourself outgrowing App Service Helpers, you can drop down to a lower level with the Microsoft Azure Client SDK for fine-tuned control or even remove ASH with minimal refactoring.
